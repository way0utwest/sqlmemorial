# Mr. Larry Toothman

Laurence Michael Toothman passed away Wednesday, April 8, 2015, from heart failure after a sudden illness. Funeral services will be 1 p.m. Tuesday, April 14, at Cedar Memorial Park Chapel of Memories, 4200 First Ave. NE, Cedar Rapids. A visitation will be held in the chapel just before the service from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Laurence was born Nov. 16, 1953, in St. Louis, Mo., to Ben and Veronie (Bohnert) Toothman. He graduated from Kirkwood High School and received a BFA in fine arts/theater from Westminster College in Fulton, Mo.

In his teen years, Laurence started working at his family's restaurant, the Green Parrot Inn, founded by his grandparents in 1938. Laurence often entertained the restaurant patrons by playing the organ, a passion he enjoyed throughout his life.

Laurence was employed at UnityPoint Health as a database administrator. Before that he had worked at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Oakdale Systems in Coralville and at Emerson Electric in St. Louis.

In 1991, he met Frank Bolick III, the man with whom he would spend the rest of his life. They were officially married in 2009 after an Iowa Supreme Court ruling allowed them to do so.

Larry, as he was known by friends, had a very kind, caring and giving soul. He was the kind of guy who would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it – even if it was his last one! Over the years, he and Frank mentored, counseled, supported and housed many, many friends.

Larry enjoyed many hobbies and passions. He was a tech geek, always wanting the newest and best technology. His huge media collection contained almost every kind of audio and video recording medium ever made. Larry was a fan of science fiction, cartoons and animation. He also loved food and was a great cook. He was a "foodie" before there was such a thing, constantly experimenting with new foods and flavors. He was famous for the dinners and parties he hosted.

Another passion – one that recently was gaining him national attention – was his computer programming and database administration skills. He was active in the SQL server world, and had given many presentations on the subject.

Larry was a passionate advocate for gay and lesbian rights. In addition, he was one of the founding fathers of the gay Bear movement. Over the years, he co-founded several Bear organizations in the Midwest, and his passion and leadership earned him national and international recognition.

Laurence "Larry" is survived by his husband of 24 years, Frank; his beloved mother, Veronie of St. Louis; brother, Louis Toothman of St. Louis; sister, Diane Hudson of St. Peters, Mo.; sisters-in-law, Susan Klingensmith of Ligonier, Pa., and Michelle Willis of Shinnston, W.Va.; and many loving nieces and nephews.

He was preceded in death by his father, Ben; in-laws, Frank and Florence Bolick Jr.; brother-in-law, Robert Hudson Jr.; his grandparents; and other family members.

In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be sent to UnityPoint/St. Luke's Hospital Foundation or the American Heart Association.
