## Thoughts and Memories from Friends


**Steve Jones**
I had the honor of knowing Mike from SQLServerCentral as a poster and author over the years. He contributed a number of articles and added to many discussions. At SQL in the City in 2019, I met him in person for the first time and hosted a panel that he participated in. He was an enthisiastic and knowledable person who I enjoyed spending the afternoon with. I was saddened to hear of his sudden passing at a young age.
