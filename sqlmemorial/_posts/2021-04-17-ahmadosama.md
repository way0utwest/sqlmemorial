## Thoughts and Memories from Friends

I am deeply saddened to share the news of the untimely demise of my friend Ahmad Osama. Such bright mind and kind hearted. a human being who demonstrated simplicity, epitome of humbleness. I share unforgettable memories with him while he worked with me at SQLMaestros & SQLServerGeeks. This is a huge loss for the community. May God give him eternal rest and the family the strength to bear the pain. While I write this, I am still not able to comprehend the tragic news. - [Amit Bansal at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amitbansal2010_i-am-deeply-saddened-to-share-the-news-of-activity-6788872394607013890-JNXi/)
