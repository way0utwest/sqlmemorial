# Mr. Tom Roush

In Tom's word, from [his blog](https://tomroush.net/about/):

Well, I’m a husband, a father, a Christian who wonders often about God and how He makes Himself known in some of the weirdest places.

I’m an observer of life, sometimes telling stories with pictures, sometimes with words.

On top of all that, I’m currently a computer geek with a degree in photojournalism who’s been told I should be a writer.

So… I’m writing.

If anyone were to ask me why I’m doing this – gosh, there are a number of reasons…

It brings me happiness – and some of the stories literally make me laugh as I’m writing (often on the bus on the way to or from work – people look at me funny when I do that).

And some made me cry – both as I experienced the event, and as I wrote about it.  (The story about my friend Betty was exceptionally hard to get over).

I find the writing brings me peace – sometimes coming to terms with things, finally learning a lesson and using the stories to share them, sharing the faith that I hold onto to get me through some of the rough spots in life, but also reliving and sharing the laughter of events both recent and in the past.

Some of the stories have lessons in them – where 30 years after the fact, I’ve had that “Aha!” moment and finally “get it”.

And some don’t… Some are just fun.

If the stories touch you in some way – let me know.  Just comment on the story – if you don’t want the comment published with the story – let me know, I’ll respect that. I’d love to hear from you.

Oh – one other reason I write…  My friend Francis felt so strongly about me writing a book that he told me, and this is as direct a quote as I can remember: “If I die before you publish your book, I’ll come back and haunt you until you do.”

So Francis – consider this my attempt to keep you off my back. 🙂

Take care…

Tom

When I get the chance to walk in his shoes via his book, I get to spend some time with my friend, all these years later. And relive his life. And miss him terribly.
