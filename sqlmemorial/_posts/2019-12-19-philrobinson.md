## Thoughts and Memories from Freinds

__Steve Jones__
I was fortunate enough to run into Phil at many events on the West Coast of the United States. A generous man, always looking to help others and give back. We had quick conversations over a cup of coffee or in a hallway, sometimes technical, sometimes community based, and I miss his generosity and warm smile.
