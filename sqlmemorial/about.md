This site was set up as a way to remember people that the SQL Family have lost. The goal is to provide an ongoing memorial for them as a way to remember them fondly.

The repository is located here: [https://github.com/way0utwest/sqlmemorial](https://github.com/way0utwest/sqlmemorial)

If you know of someone that is missing from this list, please create a new post. Instructions for creating a post are here: [creating a new memorial post](/createnewpost/)

If you wish to add a thought, memory, or picture of someone listed, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a Pull Request with the changes for that post. Some basic instructions from [Rob Sewell here](https://sqldbawithabeard.com/2019/11/29/how-to-fork-a-github-repository-and-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/).
