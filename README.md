# SQL Memorial Readme

This is a project to remember and memorialize those in the SQL Server and Data Platform communities, often called the #SQLFamily on Twitter and elsewhere.

The idea with this project is to use GitHub Pages and Jekyll to remember people that have been a part of our community. By making this an open source project, with automation, others can contribute to pages, add images, etc. that remember the people that have touched our lives.

The site is located at [sqlmemorial.org](http://www.sqlmemorial.org)
