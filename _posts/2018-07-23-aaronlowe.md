# Mr. Aaron Lowe

Aaron Lowe passed away suddenly July 23, 2018. Aaron was the founder of SQL Friends, which brought SQL Server professionals together for lunch meetings to connect, share and learn. He was co-president of the Chicago SQL Server User Group. Aaron loved to share his knowledge with the community and always encouraged others to do the same. He would tell people, “If you’ve done this for more than 6 months, you know something I don’t. Get up here and share.” Aaron is survived by his wife Rose Lew and children Talia, Alicia, Brianna, Bardell, and Whitney.
